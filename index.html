        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello, I'm Arion John</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my Personal Website. My name is Arion John and I attend Medgar Evers Prepartory School and also attend the Brooklyn Steam 
            Center. I am currently enrolled as a Full-Stack Developer. In the future, I will like to major in Computer Science Engineering/Software, and 
            Programming. Some of the stuff I do at the STEAM Center is program, making a personal website, and making different coding projects.
            I have learned about Java and JavaScript in my home school, and I am currently learning about HTML and CSS.</p>
