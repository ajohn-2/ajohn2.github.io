   <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me!</h1>
   
   <p> - I am a Full Stack Developer at the Brooklyn STEAM Center and I inspire to become a Computer Software Engineer. Welcome to my 
    personal Website so sit back, browse, explore and learn about me! I began to have an interest in computer science and programming 
    in elementary school when I was introduced to coding. From there, I always wanted to code and become a programmer, and make my 
    own designs and learn about different computer languages and how they work. But before STEAM, as said before I also attend Medgar 
    Evers Prepartory School where I learn about Java and JavaScript aswell. </p>
