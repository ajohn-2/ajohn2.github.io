   <p>Welcome to my Personal Website. My name is Arion John and I attend Medgar Evers Prepartory School and also attend the Brooklyn Steam 
    Center. I am currently enrolled as a Full-Stack Developer. In the future, I will like to major in Computer Science Engineering/Software, and 
Programming. </p>
    
    <h3>Some of the stuff I do at the STEAM Center is program, making a personal website, and making different coding projects.
        I have learned about Java and JavaScript in my home school, and I am currently learning about HTML and CSS.  </h3>
