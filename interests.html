    <h1>Daily Interests</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"></h1>
    <h2>Track and Field</h2>
    <img src="images/IMG_2720.JPG" alt="This is Arion competing in Track and Field" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p>This is me competing in Track and Field. I am a sprinter, I compete in the 100m, 200m,300m, 400m, 4x1 relay, 4x4 relay and the 4x2 relay. I run track 
        almost everyday of my life (24/8), Also, I run for my school Medgar Evers Prepartory School. Track has became apart of who I am, espcially coming from a big 
        sports family. Track comes with alot of time and dedication and that why track is the best and the hardest sport. Shoutout to the greatest coach, Coach Rodney!
    </p>

    <h2>Taking Pictures/Modeling</h2>
    <img src="images/IMG_1362.JPG" alt="This is a picture of Arion" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <img src="images/IMG_0258.jpg" alt="This is another picture of Arion, but modeling" style="width:300px;height:200px">
    <p>Taking pictures and modeling has been basically another part of me and makes me who I am, around my school, people either know 
        me for track or for modeling on somebody's page/brand. I began modeling in March 2022 for the brand Physuni(link down below)
        started by a D&E student that also goes to the Brooklyn STEAM Center. Modeling is one of the best hobbies that I have picked up outside of track 
        it has had its ups and downs with modeling.

    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <img src="images/IMG_8293_Original.jpg" alt="This is a picture of me in Philadephia for Penn Relays" style="width:300px;height:200px">
    <p>Along with the Track and Field, I have been to 2 states so far during my time in Track and Field, Philadephia and Ohio, the picture above is 
        me and my teammates exploring the city of Philly before Penn Relays , but other than that I love enjoying going out of state even if it could be 
    for Track, but the sense of traveling and looking at new places and not being in my own state, brings a different type of joy and 
    excitement.
